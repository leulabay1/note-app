- `src/features/notes`: Houses the Redux logic for managing notes using Redux Toolkit.
- `src/App.js`: The main component that composes the app's structure.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application.

## Redux Architecture

The Note App utilizes Redux Toolkit to manage state in a more efficient and organized manner. The `notesSlice.js` file under `src/features/notes` contains the Redux slice responsible for managing the notes' state.

Redux Toolkit simplifies actions, reducers, and store creation, making the state management process more intuitive and developer-friendly.
